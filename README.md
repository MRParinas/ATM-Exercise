# ATM-Exercise
ATM Exercise in REACT
Overview
The ATM Exercise is a simple web-based simulation that provides an interface for performing basic ATM operations such as deposits and withdrawals. This project is designed to demonstrate basic React.js functionalities, including state management and conditional rendering. It also incorporates form validation to ensure that users cannot withdraw more than the available balance.

Features
Dynamic UI Updates: The interface updates dynamically based on user interactions, providing immediate feedback on account balance and input validity.
Transaction Validation: Ensures that users cannot withdraw more money than they have in their account, preventing a negative balance.
Mode Selection: Users can choose between "Deposit" and "Cash Back" modes via a dropdown menu, enhancing user interaction and avoiding accidental transactions.
Responsive Design: The ATM interface is styled using CSS to be visually appealing and user-friendly. It adapts to various screen sizes and devices, ensuring a consistent user experience.
